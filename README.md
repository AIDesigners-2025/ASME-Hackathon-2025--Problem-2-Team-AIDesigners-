# ASME-Hackathon-2025--Problem-2-Team-AIDesigners-
Attention Please！

Due to time constraints, this project mainly focused on elaborating and verifying the relevant research ideas. We did not complete the model performance evaluation. Therefore, we only uploaded the slides and some of the model fine-tuning related test results, but did not upload the result.txt file. The main purpose of participating in this event was to learn from the novel and excellent ideas of other teams and guide future research. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.
